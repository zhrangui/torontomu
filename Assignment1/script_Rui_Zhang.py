### PART 1 ###
# Scikit-Learn provides many popular datasets. The breast cancer wisconsin dataset is one of them. 
# Write code that fetches the breast cancer wisconsin dataset. 
# Hint: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html
# Hint: Make sure the data features and associated target class are returned instead of a "Bunch object".

# Check how many instances we have in the dataset, and how many features describe these instances
print("There are",______, "instances described by", ______, "features.") #(4 points)  

# Create a training and test set such that the test set has 40% of the instances from the 
# complete breast cancer wisconsin dataset and that the training set has the remaining 60% of  
# the instances from the complete breast cancer wisconsin dataset, using the holdout method. 
# In addition, ensure that the training and test sets # contain approximately the same 
# percentage of instances of each target class as the complete set.

# To measure the quality of a split, using the entropy criteria.
# Ensure that nodes with less than 6 training instances are not further split

### PART 2.1 ###

______.______('Classifier Accuracy') # name the vertical axis 'Classifier Accuracy' (1 point) 

# Fill out the following blanks: #(4 points (2 points per blank)) 
""" 
According to the test accuracy, the best model to select is when the maximum depth is equal to ____, approximately. 
But, we should not use select the hyperparameters of our model using the test data, because _____.

### PART 2.2 ###
