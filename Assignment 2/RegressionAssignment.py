PART 1: basic linear regression
The goal is to predict the profit of a restaurant, based on the number of habitants where the restaurant 
is located. The chain already has several restaurants in different cities. Your goal is to model 
the relationship between the profit and the populations from the cities where they are located.

PART 2: logistic regression 
You are a recruiter and your goal is to predict whether an applicant is likely to get hired or rejected. 
You have gathered data over the years that you intend to use as a training set. 
Your task is to use logistic regression to build a model that predicts whether an applicant is likely to
be hired or not, based on the results of a first round of interview (which consisted of two technical questions).
The training instances consist of the two exam scores of each applicant, as well as the hiring decision.

PART 3: Multi-class classification using logistic regression 
Not all classification algorithms can support multi-class classification (classification tasks with more than two classes).
Logistic Regression was designed for binary classification.
One approach to alleviate this shortcoming, is to split the dataset into multiple binary classification datasets 
and fit a binary classification model on each. 
Two different examples of this approach are the One-vs-Rest and One-vs-One strategies.

############## FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS ONLY (the students enrolled in CPS 8318) ##############
""" 
PART 4 FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS ONLY: Multi-class classification using logistic regression project.
Please note that the grade for parts 1, 2, and 3 counts for 70% of your total grade. The following
work requires you to work on a project of your own and will account for the remaining 30% of your grade.

Choose a multi-Class Classification problem with a dataset (with a reasonable size) 
from one of the following sources (other sources are also possible, e.g., Kaggle):

•	UCI Machine Learning Repository, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php. 

•	KDD Cup challenges, http://www.kdd.org/kdd-cup.


Download the data, read the description, and use a logistic regression approach to solve a 
classification problem as best as you can. 
Investigate how the One-vs-Rest and One-vs-One methods can help with solving your problem.
Write up a report of approximately 2 pages, double spaced, in which you briefly describe 
the dataset (e.g., the size – number of instances and number of attributes, 
what type of data, source), the problem, the approaches that you tried and the results. 
You can use any appropriate libraries. 


Marking: Part 4 accounts for 30% of your final grade. In the write-up, cite the sources of 
your data and ideas, and use your own words to express your thoughts. 
If you have to use someone else's words or close to them, use quotes and a citation.  
The citation is a number in brackets (like [1]) that refers to a similar number in the references section 
at the end of your paper or in a footnote, where the source is given as an author, title, URL or 
journal/conference/book reference. Grammar is important. 

Submit the python script (.py file(s)) with your redacted document (PDF file) on the D2L site. 
If the dataset is not in the public domain, you also need to submit the data file. 
Name your documents appropriately:
report_Firstname_LastName.pdf
script_ Firstname_LastName.py
