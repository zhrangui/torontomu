### PART 1 ###
# Scikit-Learn provides many popular datasets. The breast cancer wisconsin dataset is one of them. 
# Write code that fetches the breast cancer wisconsin dataset.

# Hint: Make sure the data features and associated target class are returned instead of a "Bunch object".

# Create a training and test set such that the test set has 40% of the instances from the 
# complete breast cancer wisconsin dataset and that the training set has the remaining 60% of  
# the instances from the complete breast cancer wisconsin dataset, using the holdout method. 
# In addition, ensure that the training and test sets # contain approximately the same 
# percentage of instances of each target class as the complete set.

# Create a decision tree classifier. Then Train the classifier using the training dataset created earlier.
# To measure the quality of a split, using the entropy criteria.
# Ensure that nodes with less than 6 training instances are not further split

According to the test accuracy, the best model has a maximum depth of approximately 3, 5, 10, 11, or 13, which tie for the highest test accuracy. 
However, we should not use the test data to select hyperparameters because doing so can overfit to the test set and lead to an overly optimistic estimate of the model's performance.

# Use sklearn's GridSearchCV function to perform an exhaustive search to find the best tree depth and the minimum number of samples to split a node

"""
This method for tuning the hyperparameters of our model is acceptable, because it provides a systematic way to explore the hyperparameter space and find the best combination of parameters that maximizes the model's performance on unseen data.
By using cross-validation, we can ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data and that the selected hyperparameters generalize well to new data.
Using a small set of tree depths and a minimum of eight samples per split helps prevent overfitting while keeping each node representative.
Limiting depth controls model complexity, and requiring at least eight samples at each node reduces noise from very small splits, leading to a more stable classifier.
"""

# Explain below what is tenfold Stratified cross-validation?  #(4 points)
"""
Split the training dataset into 10 folds, and for each fold, train the model on the other 9 folds and validate it on the current fold. This process is repeated for all 10 folds, and the results are averaged to provide a more robust estimate of model performance.
Stratified cross-validation ensures that each fold has approximately the same percentage of samples of each target class as the complete set, which is particularly important for imbalanced datasets.
